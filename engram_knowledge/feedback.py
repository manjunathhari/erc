"""Feedback on a remembered fact or sentence (from P2.5), stored in one place: P6.1's event log.

A target is "fact:<fact_id>" or "sentence:<sid>" and must exist. Free-text comments are not stored, as P6.1 asks, so the log holds
references and a feedback word, never conversation text. Feedback changes no fact: "wrong" or "outdated" asks a person to look.
Deleting a sentence removes feedback and learned scores that point at it, or at a fact erased with it: that is P6's own delete step,
in engram_p6/forget.py. This file is the bridge from P1's references to P6's log, so it belongs to the P6 layer.
